      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p class="headp">
        The purpose of Paw Patrol is to assist homeless animals and provide care
        and placement services locally across Charlotte. Paw Patrol is a
        non-profit "all foster home" organization that is willing to provide the
        necessary resources to all animals in need of rescue. There are many
        animals out there in need of proper treatment and we would love to get
        them happy, healthy, and into new homes.
      </p>
    </header>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that all animals that come into our care should be saved, which
      is a philosophy based on no-killing. No animal should be euthanized in our
      communities if they are able to be care for, behaviorally sound, and
      healthy. No quality of life shall be taken from an animal unless those
      animals pose a threat to the public's safety.
    </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The goal is to make sure that the animals are placed in loving homes based
        on their needs and that they will not be abandoned or mistreated.
      </p>

      <h2>Volunteers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our volunteers come together, and create search groups for animals in
          poor conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          A few of the activities they participate in include grooming, playing,
          feeding, and training.
        </li>
        <li>
          They help with teaching the young about how to care for the animals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Paw Patrol was founded on August 7, 2017. The organization just turned 5
          years!
        </li>
        <li>
          Served in 3 locations:
          <br> - University City Blvd
          <br> - The Plaza
          <br> - Sugar Creek
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2019, we opened our very first animal shelter and adoption center.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2021, we expanded our facility to include a wellness clinic,
          spay/neuter clinic, and have grown our adoption center.
