      <p class="headp">
        The purpose of Paw Patrol is to assist homeless animals and provide care
        and placement services locally across Charlotte. Paw Patrol is a
        non-profit "all foster home" organization that is willing to provide the
        necessary resources to all animals in need of rescue. There are many
        animals out there in need of proper treatment and we would love to get
        them happy, healthy, and into new homes.

      <h2>Values</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that all animals that come into our care should be saved,
        which is a philosophy based on no-killing. No animal should be
        euthanized in our communities if they are able to be care for,
        behaviorally sound, and healthy. No quality of life shall be taken from
        an animal unless those animals pose a threat to the public's safety.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure that the animals are not abandoned or mistreated, we strive to
        place them in loving homes based on their needs. As a community and with
        friends' and families' help, we think we can accomplish this.
      </p>

      <h2>Volunteers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our volunteers come together, and create search groups for animals in
          poor conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          A few of the activities they participate in include grooming, playing,
          feeding, and training.
        </li>
        <li>
          They help with teaching the young about how to care for the animals.
        </li>
      </ul>
